Development first began in 2010 when Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the book. In July 2015, Spielberg directed and produced the film, with casting for the film beginning in September 2015. Filming began in England in July 2016 and was completed in September 2016. The visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Digital Domain, and Territory Studio, with some pre-visualization done by The Third Floor. As with the novel, several popular culture references appear throughout the film, with references to Back to the Future, The Iron Giant, and The Shining appearing most prominently.

Ready Player One premiered at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $582 million, as well as nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and 72nd British Academy Film Awards, all for visual effects, but all lost to First Man and Black Panther, respectively.
